# Surfs_Up

Overview of Surfs_Up Challenge
This analysis was performed in order to determine if a surf shop business model represents a potentially beneficial year round investment for the months of June and December in Oahu. Previously, an investor did not recieve a good return due to the property being rained out. Determined not to repeat the same mistake, a data set was provided by W. Avy in order to aid in the analysis of weather patterns on the island.
